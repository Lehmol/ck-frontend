## Usage
As an application developer, it is desirable to have templates to enable reusable page layouts. It is proposed to create a ./src/templates folder for layout shells and page composition, where each template only exposes props and does not fetch data. A PageShell.template.jsx file and a README.md should be provided to describe how to use the templates.
